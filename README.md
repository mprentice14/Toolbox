# About Me

### Who I Am  
I’m an experienced IT professional with 6+ years in the industry, evolving from a Systems Engineer/Linux Administrator into the world of DevOps. This journey has equipped me with a broad skill set—ranging from maintaining large-scale server environments to optimizing CI/CD pipelines and container orchestration.

### What I Do  
My professional interests span a variety of emerging technologies and practices:
- **DevOps & Cloud**: Crafting scalable infrastructure, automating workflows, and monitoring distributed systems.
- **AI & ML Projects**: Experimenting with models and algorithms to create intelligent, data-driven solutions.
- **Kubernetes & Containerization**: Managing workloads in dynamic cluster environments, ensuring resilience and reliability.
- **Networking & Observability**: Implementing robust monitoring tools and methodologies to maintain system health and performance.

### Beyond the Keyboard  
I’m not just about servers and scripts. Creativity and exploration fuel my personal life:
- **Authoring Sci-Fi/Cyberpunk**: I’m a self-published author, and my debut novel, *Soul Diver*, reflects my fascination with futuristic worlds and humanity’s relationship with technology.
- **Astrophotography**: From capturing star clusters to distant galaxies, I find inspiration in the cosmic canvas.
- **3D Printing**: I love bringing digital concepts into the physical world, turning ideas into tangible prototypes and art pieces.

### Personal Life  
At home, I’m happily married and stay busy as a softball dad to my 10-year-old daughter—her year-round season keeps our family on the move. When I’m not on the field, we might be enjoying a good movie night or flipping burgers on the grill.
