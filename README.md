## About Me

I have been in IT for 6 years, transitioning from a System Engineer/Linux Sys Admin to a new DevOps role. I enjoy developing personal projects like AI, network monitoring Kubernetes clusters, and anything else that sparks my interest.

I'm a self-published author in the Sci-Fi/Cyberpunk genre, with my debut novel **"Soul Diver"**. I'm also an avid astrophotographer and 3D printing hobbyist.

I'm married with a 10-year-old daughter who keeps us busy with softball year-round.
